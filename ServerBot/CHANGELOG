* CommandBot is an actual bot now.
* Bot no longer echoes commands. When a player uses a bot command, it is silent.
	* Nevermind it's actually pretty necessary.
* Added new command handler.
* Moving commands to new command handler.
* Removed "^ help" but kept "^ help item" and "^ help register"
* Added Bot.Private method to say something to a specific player.
* Utils.LogToConsole also logs to log file now so that I don't have to repeat Log.Info every 5 seconds.
